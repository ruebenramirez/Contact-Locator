Current state
---------------------------------------------------

* custom PHP admin interface + customer facing interface
* Contact-Locator originated from a module I wrote to help a company display reseller listings by entering a US zip code, or International Country, with specific product filter selections.


---------------------------------------------------
New Features to develop
---------------------------------------------------


I would like to extend this code to allow users to find contacts based on entry of:
* phone number (listing of contacts by phone area code lookup mapped to centrilized geo-coordinates)
* State
* International Country
* International Zip code
* US City
* International City


I would also like to allow for additional search criteria to become a dynamic admin filter mechanism
* abstract logic from product specific lookup filters to generic lookup filters (of different datatypes)
* create an admin module to define lookup filters (including datatypes used)
* create an admin module to design the client facing fields/UI


---------------------------------------------------
Codebase changes - refactoring and such
---------------------------------------------------


Migrate OOP code base into an MVC deployment
* research Joomla module
* research CodeIgniter
