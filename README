Current state
---------------------------------------------------

	* custom PHP admin interface + customer facing interface
	* Contact-Locator originated from a module I wrote to help a company display reseller listings by entering a US zip code, or International Country, with specific product filter selections.
	* on add new contact, check entered address via Google Maps plugin

---------------------------------------------------
New Features to develop
---------------------------------------------------


I would like to extend this code to allow users to find contacts based on entry of:
	* phone number (listing of contacts by phone area code lookup mapped to centrilized geo-coordinates)
	* State
	* International Country
	* International Zip code
	* US City
	* International City


I would also like to allow for additional search criteria to become a dynamic admin filter mechanism
	* abstract logic from product specific lookup filters to generic lookup filters (of different datatypes)
	* create an admin module to define lookup filters (including datatypes used)
	* create an admin module to design the client facing fields/UI

More admin stuff
	* allow users to upload and modify images per contact, or per contact grouping
	* allow users to input their own Google Maps API key (via the admin interface)

---------------------------------------------------
Codebase changes - refactoring and such
---------------------------------------------------


Migrate OOP code base into an MVC deployment
	* implement some kind of free-standing security (so that the code can live on it's own for the time being)
	* research Joomla module composition from a free-form module
	* research CodeIgniter
