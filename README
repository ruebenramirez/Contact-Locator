Contact-Locator originated from a module I wrote to help a company display reseller listing information by entering a zip code.

Ideally I would like to extend this code to allow users to find contacts based on entry of:
* phone number (listing of contacts by phone area code lookup mapped to centrilized geo-coordinates)
* State
* International Country
* International Zip code
* US City
* International City
